Proofpoint Cloud Management (PCM) is a cloud-agnostic SaaS deployment tool that provides support for managed
software deployment. PCM provides a user with the capability to manage virtual machine instances within any
supported cloud environment, including public clouds such as Amazon Web Services. Furthermore, PCM can assemble
managed virtual machines into complex software systems by instantiating and applying application and system
configuration templates captured in a tool such as Puppet.
